Bagur, 2024)](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04791294v1/file/123923_BAGUR_2024_archivage.pdf). Indeed, the domain must be limited. If limited too close to the region of interest (ROI), **boundary effects** appear and disturb the solution. However, the **curse of dimensionality** makes it complicated to place the boundaries too far from the ROI since their complexity if of the order of $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "In ECM, fractures are modeled implicitly by modifying the hydro-mechanical properties (e.g., equivalent permeability and stiffness tensors) of a continuum model to take into account fracture properties of fractures. The characteristics of the fractures are then homogeneized by this continuum ([Yan et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955799722001400) ; [Mortazavi et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431123007846)).\n",
    "\n",
    "It offers the lowest computational cost, making it attractive for large-scale simulations. It is appropriate for modeling short cracks where explicit detailing of each fracture is not computationally feasible or cost-effective. Two major limitations are its inability to accurately consider mass transfer between the matrix and individual fractures explicitly, and the lack of explicit distinction between the fracture network and the rock matrix, making it difficult to represent the preferential flow paths in fractures ([Yan et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955799722001400) ; [Mortazavi et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431123007846)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dual-Continuum Model (DCM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "DCM models the fractured porous medium as two overlapping continua: one representing the rock matrix and the other representing the fracture network. Each continuum is assigned its own porosity and permeability, and they are coupled by a transfer function that describes flux exchange between them. This is important since the permeability of the fault can be up to 10⁵ higher than the permeability of the matrix ([Yan et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955799722001400); [Mortazavi et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431123007846)).\n",

They enable natural crack nucleation and propagation, can handle complex crack patterns and are thermodynamically consistent. However, they cannot model sharp jumps and suffer from an important dependence on numerical parameters. Finally, they need very fine meshes in order to resolve the cracks properly, making them computationally prohibitive [Mortazavi et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431123007846).\n",

However, the mesh has to resolve the characteristic length of cracks and cracks may appear everywhere, making it less cntrollable. Finally, its higher memory usage makes it less scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discrete Fracture Model (DFM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "DFM is a very close model to the variational formulation. In DFM, fractures are explicitly represented as lower-dimensional objects embedded within a higher-dimensional matrix. Fluid flow within these fracture elements is typically governed by the cubic law, and this flow is coupled to Darcy flow in the surrounding matrix via leak-off terms ([Mortazavi et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431123007846)).\n",

    "\n",
    "However, a significant drawback of DFM is the requirement for a detailed, transient mesh that conforms precisely to the location and geometry of the fractures. This often necessitates highly refined meshes in order to align with the fault planes, particularly for complex or dynamically evolving fracture networks. Geometric constraints imposed by complex fault geometries can also make mesh generation extremely challenging and lead to aberrations ([Mortazavi et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431123007846)).\n",

    "\n",
    "The presence of an oblique normal fault directly impacts pressure drawdown, thermal breakthrough, and overall heat-extraction performance. The inclination and roughness of the fault have a big influence on the breakthrough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the permeability of the faults being up to 10⁵ that of the matrix, its properties must be studied very carefully. ([Lv et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375650522001134))\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pressure drawdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the fault is highly permeable (e.g., due to a large aperture or enhanced permeability from shear dilation), it can act as a preferential flow path, leading to rapid fluid movement along its plane. This can result in a faster pressure drop between injection and production wells if the fault connects them efficiently. For example, if the fault's inclination aligns closely with the injection-production (I-P) diagonal, the working fluid flows along this alignment, traveling a shorter distance and resulting in a higher rate of water production. Conversely, if the fault acts as a barrier (e.g., due to mineralization), it can impede fluid flow, leading to higher pressure buildup on the injection side and reduced pressure drawdown on the extraction side. ([Lv et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375650522001134), [Okoroafor et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375650522000086))\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, an increase in fluid pressure can lead to fault dilation. This, in turn, enhances its permeability (via the cubic law) and leads to a faster pressure drawdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thermal breakthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermal breakthrough, the point at which cold injected fluid reaches the production well, causing a sharp drop in extracted fluid temperature, is highly sensitive to the fault's presence and characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the oblique normal fault acts as a high-permeability path and is aligned with the I-P diagonal, it can create a short-circuit between the injection and production wells. This allows the cold injected fluid to bypass a larger volume of hot rock, leading to premature thermal breakthrough and a significant reduction in the efficiency of heat extraction. ([Lv et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375650522001134), [Okoroafor et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375650522000086))\n",
    "However, if the fault is perpendicular to the I-P diagonal, it will act like a barrier, delaying the thermal breakthrough.\n",
    "Finally, there is a lower flow-wetted surface in I-P faults with respect to perpendicular faults ([Okoroafor et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375650522000086)). That means I-P faults result in a lower heat extraction performance, leading to an even faster thermal breakthrough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, a larger fracture aperture, while increasing flow rate, can also reduce the flow-wetted surface area per unit volume of fluid, limiting heat transfer from the rock to the fluid. However, a surface fracture with higher spatial variations in aperture can result in greater heat extraction due to a larger surface area for heat transfer ([Okoroafor et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375650522000086)).\n",
